\section{Education}
	Illinois Institute of Technology \hfill
	{\centering Computer Science} 
	 \hfill December 2017 \\
	Master's of Science and Bachelor's of Science \\
	Applied Mathematics Minor \\
	Cumulative GPA: 3.07/4.0 \hfill
	Major GPA: 3.0/4.0

	East China Normal University \hfill Summer 2014  
\section{Projects}
\textbf{\textit{Android Development}}
	\vspace*{.25em}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Created several Android Applications for the Google Play Store under the developer name Mingo Technology.
		\item Signed a contract with Greenville Public School District in 2012 to create Android Applications for all the schools in their district, approximately 13 schools. 
		\item \textbf{Physics:Mechanics}, an application I created in 2012 that acts as a physics calculator. Users input known variables for an equation and the application solves for the unknown variable. The application also includes a physics dictionary for several common physics terms. 
		\item \textbf{Unit Converter}, an application I created in 2013 that allows users to convert from one unit of measurement to another unit for several quantities, including but not limited to weight, height, temperature, speed, and time. 
	\end{itemize} 
\textbf{\textit{Web Development}}
	\vspace*{.25em}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{RealTexting.net}, currently discounted, was a website that allowed users to send messages from the website to phones. The website was hosted as a Microsoft Azure Web App, written in ASP.NET MVC C\#, and was backed by a SQL Server database. The website worked for carriers in the US and Canada before being discontinued. 
		\item \textbf{AnthonyHicksIII.com}, my personal website written by me. The back-end is written in PHP. The front-end is written using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The website also uses jQuery, the Foundation CSS Framework, and the Slick JavaScript library.
	\end{itemize}
\textbf{\textit{Class Projects}}
	\vspace*{.25em}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{REST API for Advertisers}, created a REST API application in Java using Jersey and Tomcat. The API allows advertisers to put an advertisement listing on a website for a certain category, similar to Google and Amazon Ads.The API also allows the advertisers to delete listings. The REST service supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The application had to be deployed on a Linux machine and installation had to be automated. 
	\end{itemize}
